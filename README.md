# 2020 In Text

Contributions to this codebase are 100% welcomed and encouraged.

Do you see changes you could make to this code to make the compiled application more fit for purpose?

The application is built using the Ionic Framework, which is an open source SDK for application development. The language of this codebase is majoratively TypeScript for all of the React/Ionic front end code. This is obviously not constant, and high level suggestions to improve the ecosystem this project sits in are always encouraged.

Changes should be submitted using the normal GitHub work-flow. Pull requests to construct a start to finish explanation and implementation of a new commit to the project.
